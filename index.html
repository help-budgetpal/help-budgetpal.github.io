    <h1>Welcome to BudgetPal</h1>
    <p>BudgetPal is a desktop app that makes monthly expense tracking effortless. Instead of manually entering each
        transaction, you can simply download your bank CSV and let BudgetPal automatically populate your Google Sheets
        with categorized data.</p>

    <p>This app is designed with simplicity and privacy in mind â€” your financial data stays on your device and is only
        shared with Google Sheets that you explicitly authorize.</p>
