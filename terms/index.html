    </ul>

    <h2>3. Google Account and Data Access</h2>
    <p>To use BudgetPal, you must authorize the application to access your Google account using OAuth 2.0. This access is limited to the permissions required to read basic profile information (such as your email) and to access specific Google Sheets files you select via the Google File Picker.</p>
    <p>BudgetPal does not access your entire Google Drive. It only works with the files you explicitly choose. Your Google credentials and access token are not stored on any external servers; they remain securely on your local machine and are used solely to enable the app’s core features.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may not use BudgetPal to upload or process unlawful, harmful, or fraudulent content.</li>
        <li>You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, or otherwise tamper with the application.</li>
        <li>Use of BudgetPal is subject to Google’s terms of service when interacting with Google Sheets or Drive APIs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Software Updates</h2>
    <p>BudgetPal may occasionally release updates to improve functionality or security. It is your responsibility to keep the application updated to the latest version.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>BudgetPal is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the application will be error-free or that it will meet your requirements.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall BudgetPal or its creators be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or related to your use of the application.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate your access to BudgetPal at any time if you violate these terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
